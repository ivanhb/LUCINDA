### Is an RDF data browser Javascript-based application.  

This idea came out with regard to the [OpenCitations](http://opencitations.net/) project, which contains an open repository of scholarly citation data in RDF format, we would like to make accesible for any user to search and explore. 
LUCINDA uses [OSCAR](https://github.com/ivanhb/OSCAR) and its features: which is a general search application for rdf data specially designed for open citations.

One of the main characteristics of LUCINDA is its adaptability to work with any other RDF triplestore. In order to do that there is a configuration file that could be adopted according to the SPARQL endpoint we wish to integrate.
